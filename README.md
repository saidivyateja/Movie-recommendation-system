# Recommendation Engine for Movies, Anime, and TV Shows based on Content-Based Filtering in Streamlit 
The Content-Based Filtering Recommendation System for Movies, Anime, and TV Shows using Streamlit is a project focused on providing personalized content suggestions to users based on their preferences and ratings. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system analyzes the characteristics of movies, anime, and TV shows, such as genre, director, and cast, to create a profile for each item. Users input their ratings, enabling the system to build a personalized user profile. The recommendation engine, driven by a machine learning model, then suggests content aligning with the user's preferences. The user-friendly interface, developed with Streamlit, offers an interactive platform for users to explore recommendations dynamically and adjust preferences, enhancing the overall experience. The goal is to deploy a scalable and maintainable web application that delivers tailored content suggestions in an engaging manner.
